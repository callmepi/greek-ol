CSS ruleset generator for Ionic numbered ol-li list block



## Greek numerals

[or Ionic or Ionian or Alexandrian numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals),
are a system of writing numbers
using the letters of the Greek alphabet. Although the system is not used
in greek mathematics anymore, it does exist for ordered-lists in Greek texts.

No browser supports this numeral system inherently;  
that's what this library is for.

**NOTE**:   
Although the library can generate all CSS rules needed for ordered lists
up to 999.999 greek-numbered items _it is not recomended to create
such huge lists_; Usually, any list up to several hundrends is pretty enough.



## Installation and use

The project is under development; Still it is a minimum viable product.

How use it: 

* download the code and copy ```css/gre.css``` to your css|assets folder
* In your HTML, include a link to the gre.css
